          Before joining Protocol Labs, Alfonso de la Rocha worked as a
          blockchain expert at Telefónica R&D, where he was responsible for the
          design and development of core technology based on blockchains,
          distributed systems, and advanced cryptography. Alfonso’s involvement
          in research and development began at Universidad Politécnica de
          Madrid, where he worked on topics related to energy efficiency in data
          centers. His broad R&D experience also includes research into the
          compression efficiency of video coding standards at Ericsson Research
          and projects related to securing interdomain routing protocols at KTH
          Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Alfonso is also an avid
          reader and basketball lover.
